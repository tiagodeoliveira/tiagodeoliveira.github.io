## What I Do

I architect and personally build generative AI platforms that handle **tens of millions of concurrent requests**. Not just design—I write the proof of concepts, optimize the critical paths, and guide teams through implementation. Currently leading telecom-native GenAI initiatives that are redefining how billions of users will interact with AI.

My approach: Frame the business problem → Build the POC myself → Architect for massive scale → Lead implementation → Optimize until it handles 10x the load. I code in Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript, and Java—whatever gets the job done best.

From first principles thinking learned fixing trucks at age 8 to designing evolutionary AI platforms at AWS—I bring a unique perspective that simplifies complex problems and delivers measurable impact.

## Why I'm Different

**I build what I design.** No ivory tower architecture—I write the POCs, optimize the critical paths, and debug production issues at 3 AM.

**First principles from fixing trucks.** 13 years as a mechanic taught me how systems really work. Every complex system can be understood, debugged, and improved.

**Scale isn't theoretical to me.** I've built systems serving millions. When I say "massive scale" I mean it—not slides, actual running code.

**Fast learner.** New framework? Give me a weekend. New domain? Give me a week. I learn by building, not reading.

**Humble despite the resume.** Started at the bottom, earned everything through grit. I know everyone has something to teach me.

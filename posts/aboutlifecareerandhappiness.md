# About Life Career And Happiness

The other day I saw Andy Jassy's [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-jassy-8b1615_today-is-my-25th-anniversary-at-amazon-activity-6927972219654483968-uFhr?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) about how he started his professional career, how he jumped from college to Amazon, and how he has been there for the last 25 years.

That made me think about my career. I started thinking about how my life was when I began working, about the little perspective I had, about the things I never imagined I would be able to do.

I decided to write it down just for the sake of the exercise. After I wrote it, I thought: how many people might have aspirations and dreams but are tied to their harsh reality? I am fortunate to have the chances I had, but how many people will never be able to pursue their dreams just because the reality does not allow them!

I am a very reserved person, but I, again, thought: screw, I'll share it! If I can reach one person and give them the boost they need to keep pushing it, I have already changed the world (at least for that person and myself).

Here it is üòÅ

* In 1994, at eight years old, I started working at my dad's truck mechanical shop. I learned how to weld, how to fix trucks, how to use power tools, and how hard it is to make a living. I used to go into the tanks to spot the leaking points and get them welded; I was small, so it was easy for me to pass through the narrow door. I studied at a public school, didn't have money to buy food at the school canteen, and dreamed of having a soccer shoe and a Gr√™mio's jersey.

* In 1998, my dad and I moved to a neighboring city; he moved his shop to that city to try and make more money. My mom and siblings stayed in my hometown. We didn't have money to visit them that often, so we were apart for three weeks or so unless we managed to get a lift with someone going in that direction.

* In 2000 we moved back to my hometown and restarted our truck mechanic shop there after the attempt to expand the business had failed.

* In 2001 my mom found me a job at a supermarket. According to her, I had to have professional experience under my belt. I worked in the warehouse unloading trucks and helped pack things at the cashier, clean the cold storage, and prepare the vegetables at their stands. I went to high school during the night period. I had a "special pass" to arrive at the school late since the supermarket hours would go over after the classes had already started. Many nights I just fell asleep at my desk.

* In 2004 my mom "forced" me to do a technical course at the local university. I had no pretensions about studying nor the money to pay the tuition fee. I left the supermarket and joined my dad's truck mechanical shop again.

* In 2005 I started working as an intern at the university. I hauled equipment (29" TVs equipped with VCR and overhead projectors) and fixed old Pentium III and AMD K6 computers used at the informatics lab.

* In 2006 as I was finishing my technical degree, I joined a company as a software developer in a neighboring city. I worked with Delphi 7, developing financial systems, mainly doing reverse engineering to extract data from competitors' systems and helping customers to migrate to our platform. I had to drive for one and a half hours each way, and on many nights I got home and didn't know how I had done that. I couldn't remember driving back.

* In 2008 I was fired along with two other colleagues because we were getting together after work to try and create our software, not related to the company's solution at all.

* Until 2009 we tried to make our software, but I couldn't sustain living without an income, and our business was not yielding many results.

* Later in 2009, I came back to my dad's shop. During the following years, I tried to make the business bigger, manufacturing machines (tube bending, woodcutting, and agricultural), and innovating in any way. Despite being able to create machines, do automation, and grow the business, I failed miserably in making that financially viable. I fought depression for years and hit bottom.

* In 2013, after many struggles and massive debt, with my family's support, I decided to try and find a paid job, close the business and slowly pay the debt.

* In mid-2013, I started working as an ERP consultant, traveling to customers and implementing specific features in their systems.

* Later in 2013, I was invited to interview at Nokia in another state, far away from my hometown. It was hard to believe I was even considered. And I got an offer! I moved to the big city to work for a multinational company, with my frail English and limited technical knowledge. My paycheck was enough to pay the rent and barely eat.

* Two months later, I got another offer from another multinational in another capital in another state. Shy of 2013 end, I started at Dell. Making 40% more, a salary I never imagined I would be able to have.

* In 2015 I moved to another company in the same city, making 70% more and being recognized as a Senior Engineer. Later I was promoted to Senior Software Architect.

* In 2016 I moved to another multinational, on an international project, as a Senior Software Architect. I was making six figures, being the leader of a project, being respected as a tech professional, and being a reference to my colleagues.

* Mid 2017, I moved to Germany to work as a Senior Engineer on a fintech. Again, I could never, in my wildest dreams, imagine living abroad.

* A couple of years later, I moved to Stuttgart to be an Enterprise Architect for Mercedes-Benz. And actually drove a Mercedes for the first time in my life.

* 2020 I joined AWS as a Senior Solutions Architect.

* 2021 I was transferred to the United States as a Senior Product Solutions Architect.

* 2022 I am as happy as a clam, working with amazing people, being recognized for my expertise, and with a full range of possibilities ahead. And now I know there are no limits; I can do whatever I want to!

I have learned so much, I have met so many incredible people, and I have made so many friends along this journey. I am just glad I was given the gift of living all this!
